# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
## ABSTRACT

This project involves developing a machine learning module that enables the client bank to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, ultimately saving both the bank and its customers money. I learned making such a model during an internship I attended in Externsclub, a data science cource, where I gained a deeper understanding of its applications and its broader impact on society

Through machine learning, we're able to analyze vast amounts of transaction data, identifying subtle patterns that could indicate fraudulent activity. Traditional rule-based systems are limited in their ability to adapt to new or evolving types of fraud. However, machine learning models, especially those trained on large datasets, can continuously improve, learning from both past and current data to make increasingly accurate predictions

Working on this project has shown me how impactful machine learning can be in the real world. By detecting and preventing fraud, we help reduce financial losses and contribute to a more secure banking environment. This not only protects the bank's resources but also safeguards customers' financial well-being. It's satisfying to know that the technology I'm working on directly helps maintain trust in financial systems and contributes to preventing financial crimes.
